            <p id="casecap">After an initial period of research I ran a callaborative brand workshop to delve into the characteristics of The Studio’s identity. The outputs of this workshop were distilled into a set of brand principles we used to shape the design work.</p>

            <p id="casecap">The identity was packaged as a toolkit of styles, rather than a prescriptive set of guidelines. This gave the freedom to create unique artworks for a range of applications - from coffee cups to workplace posters. The new Studio team took the outputs from our work and continued to develop the concept before officially launching the agency.</p>
